# Evaluate models using appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, MAE, etc.) 
# based on the problem (classification, regression, clustering, etc.). 
# For example, if the problem is a classification problem, you can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. 
# If the problem is a regression problem, you can use metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.
