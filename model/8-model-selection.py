# Choosing a right model for the dataset
# Model Selection (Select a model that is suitable for the data)
# Based on the problem (classification, regression, clustering, etc.), choose a model that is suitable for the data. For example, if the problem is a classification problem, you can choose models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc. If the problem is a regression problem, you can choose models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc. 
# If the problem is a clustering problem, you can choose models like K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.
# Split the data into training and testing sets
